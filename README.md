Customer Churn Prediction App

Overview: This Streamlit web app predicts customer churn using machine learning models based on telecom data.

Users can explore data visualizations, compare different K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models, and make predictions by entering customer-specific information.

Features
Interactive Visualizations:
- Parallel Coordinates Plot
- Pair Plots
- Correlation Heatmaps

Model Comparison
Four KNN models are tested and compared using confusion matrices, crosstabs, and classification reports.

Cross-Validation and K-Tuning
Each model is tuned using 10-fold cross-validation to select the optimal k value.

User Prediction Tool
Enter customer service calls and day charges to predict whether a customer will churn.
